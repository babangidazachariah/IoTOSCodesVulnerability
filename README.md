# Machine Learning Based Vulnerability Detection in Internet of Things Operating System’s Codes
There has been a lot of the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems in various domains and aspects of life. From healthcare, smart homes, smart cities,  smart agriculture, robotics, autonomous driving systems, traffic engineering, and to surveilance or monitoring as well as many others, too numerous to mention. Though there has been significant acceptance and deployment of these IoT systems, there are concerns about user security and privacy issues. This is because the IoT systems are becoming an integral part of human lives and essentially carry information that could expose personal details of users of such systems; most especially in the area of healthcare systems. 
This project address the challenge of vulnerbilities in IoT systems operating systems codes, by training and assessing machine learning models on labeled dataset. The used dataset is from Al-Boghdady [1]. LinearSVC, SVC, AdaBoost, and ExtraTrees Classifiers were trained using the dataset and ExtraTrees achieved comparable performance in the multiclass classification task.
